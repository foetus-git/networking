# networking

_Intentions_:

1. Keep it simple: Simple definition-based attitude 
   _(simple sentence, simple concepts, simple language)_
2. Fully linked for easy-wide access
3. Scalable knowledge through links/extra panes to give deeper info to who wants it
4. Try to be ORIGINAL...rewriting needed using personal understanding
5. follow a recognizable model, the same framework, for every page
	(format, writing, styles, attitude)
6. Try to write autarchic pages {self-explicative}
7. Translation to all possible languages
8. Treat arguments gradually from small to big
	(first local net then remote net, following Models sorted)
9. Evaluate arguments by importance or deepening level
